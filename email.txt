Why I Email only 4 Times a Day

1. Morning
2. Lunch
3. Afternoon ☕️
4. End of Day

We've all had the experience of starting the day
with a list of things to do, spending the whole morning
dealing with your inbox, and suddenly realizing
it's 3pm and your list is longer than when you started!

I believe email (and other messages) provide
a false sense of productivity. My emails are ABOUT
the things I should be doing, they are not WHAT
I should be doing (usually).

I've found that doing all my communication in batches
makes my days more free and focused. You should try it!
