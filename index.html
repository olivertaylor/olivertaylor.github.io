<h2>OLIVER TAYLOR

<p>Hi. I'm Oliver and this is my site. That's the only introduction I could think of.</p>

<h3>TEXTPLAY</h3>
<p>Textplay is command-line utility that converts screenplays written in <a href="http://fountain.io">Fountain</a> formatted plain-text to a variety of useful formats: HTML, FDX (<a href="http://support.finaldraft.com/article.aspx?cid=1001&amp;aid=325">Final Draft</a>), and (with <a href="http://princexml.com">PrinceXML</a>) PDF.</p>

<h3>TWO REASONS FOR WRITING IN PLAIN TEXT</h3>
<p>Almost every website, piece of software, or communication protocol ever programed was written (at least in part) in plain-text. This makes it the most compatible, reliable, and flexible file-format in existence; one who writes in plain-text can rest assured their files will be readable forever by any computer ever made in their lifetime.</p>
<p>Because programmers work almost exclusively in plain-text they have built themselves amazing tools. With a little work one can learn how to leverage these powerful tools and customize their writing environment as they see fit.</p>
<p>For those who want a universal and future-proof way to store their writing, and powerful and reliable software to write in, plain-text is the ticket.</p>

<H3>SEMANTIC LINEFEEDS</H3>

<p>The single most important thing I do when writing, from a computing standpoint, is to put each clause or idea of a sentence on a separate line. I got the idea <a href="http://rhodesmill.org/brandon/2012/one-sentence-per-line/">from Brandon Rhodes (via Brian W. Kernighan)</a> and have been using it ever since. Here's how he explains it:</p>

<blockquote><p>By starting a new line at the end of each sentence, and splitting sentences themselves at natural breaks between clauses, a text file becomes far easier to edit and version control. Text editors are very good at manipulating lines -- so when each sentence is a contiguous block of lines, your editor suddenly becomes a very powerful mechanism for quickly rearranging clauses and ideas.</p></blockquote>

<p>Splitting each clause of a sentence into separate lines more clearly highlights the structure of a sentence. Apparently, Buckminster Fuller called it "<a href="https://vanemden.wordpress.com/2009/01/01/ventilated-prose/">Ventilated Prose</a>". The effect has been so profound that I now write by hand in this way. (There's even an <a href="http://www.xkcd.com/1285/">xkcd comic</a> about it.)</p>
