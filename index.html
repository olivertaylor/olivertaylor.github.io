<h2>BBEdit Movement & Selection Shortcuts</h2>
<p class="download"><a href="https://github.com/olivertaylor/BetterTongs.bbpackage/archive/master.zip">Download</a> - <a href="http://git.io/bettertongs">GitHub</a></p>
<p>I recently became obsessed with cursor movement and selection shortcuts in BBEdit. I spend an enormous amount of time restructuring and rephrasing prose sentences - writing is rewriting after all. Sadly, our digital tools for this are cruelly limiting. In fact, we only have one tool: the insertion point. You can move it or expand it, and there are some shortcuts for this, but we are bound by its up/down left/right more/less limits. I fear my arrow keys will wear out. In an age of automation, it is an appallingly manual process. At times it feels like building a house with kitchen tongs.</p>
<p>We cannot choose a more advanced alternative, but we can build a better pair of tongs.</p>
<p>While BBEdit has many great tools for prose writers, its cursor movement and selection shortcuts do not compare impressively with its own coding shortcuts, or with certain <a href="http://vim.org">other editors</a>. This package of scripts aims to substantially improve your movement and selection abilities when writing prose in BBEdit.</p>
<p>It should be noted that I am not the author of a number of these scripts. Many are stolen from various like-minded people (I've tried, sometimes unsuccessfully, to credit the authors), and from the very generous members of <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/bbedit">BBEdit's Mailing List</a>.</p>

<h2>Two Reasons for Writing in Plain Text</h2>
<p>Almost every website, piece of software, or communication protocol ever programed was written (at least in part) in plain-text. This makes it the most compatible, reliable, and flexible file-format in existence; one who writes in plain-text can rest assured their files will be readable forever by any computer ever made in their lifetime.</p>
<p>Because programmers work almost exclusively in plain-text they have built themselves amazing tools. With a little work one can learn how to leverage these powerful tools and customize their writing environment as they see fit.</p>
<p>For those who want a universal and future-proof way to store their writing, and powerful and reliable software to write in, plain-text is the ticket.</p>

<h2>Perfection</h2>
<p><i>From “Wind, Sand, and Stars” by Antoine de Saint-Exupéry</i></p>
<p>In anything at all, perfection is finally attained not when there is no longer anything to add, but when there is no longer anything to take away, when the body has been stripped down to its nakedness.</p>
<p>It results from this that perfection of invention touches hands with absence of invention, as if that line which the human I will follow with effortless delight were a line that had not been invented but simply discovered, had in the beginning been hidden by nature and in the end found by the engineer. There is an ancient myth about the image asleep in the block of marble until it is carefully disengaged by the sculptor. The sculptor must himself feel that he is not so much inventing or shaping the curve of breast or shoulder as delivering the image from its prison.</p>
<p>In this spirit do engineers, physicists concerned with thermodynamics, and the swarm of preoccupied draughtsmen tackle their work. In appearance, but only in appearance, they seem to be polishing surfaces and refining away angles, easing this joint or stabilizing that wing, rendering these parts invisible, so that in the end there is no longer a wing hooked to a framework but a form flawless in its perfection, completely disengage from its matrix, a sort of spontaneous hole, its parts mysteriously fused together and resembling in their unity a poem.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, startling as it is that all visible evidence of invention should have been refined out of this instrument and that there should be delivered to us an object as natural as a pebble polished by the waves, it is equally wonderful that he who uses this instrument should be able to forget that it is a machine.</p>

<h2>Revelation of the Complex</h2>
<p><i>From “The Visual Display of Quantitative Information” by Edward Tufte</i></p>
<p>Design is a choice. The theory of the visual display of quantitative information consists of principles that generate design options and that guide choices among options. The principles should not be applied rigidly or in peevish spirit; they are not logically for mathematically certain; and it is better to violate any principal than to place graceless or in elegant marks on paper. Most principles of design should be greeted with some skepticism, for word authority can dominate our vision, and we may come to see only through the lenses of word authority rather than with our own eyes.</p>
<p>What is to be sought in designs for the display of information is the clear portrayal of complexity. Not the complication of the simple; rather the task of the designer is to give visual access to the subtle and difficult - that is, the revelation of the complex.</p>
