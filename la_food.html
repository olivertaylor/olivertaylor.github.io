<h1>Oliver's Favorite L.A. Restuarants</h1>
<p>Here in Los Angeles you can get some of the best food in the world, and no matter where you are in the city there are thousands of wonderful restaurants near you. This guide is a list of my favorite places (I’ve been to all of them), organized by neighborhood.</p>

<h2>Burbank / The Valley</h2>

<article onclick="selectArticle(this)">
<h2><a href="http://www.portosbakery.com">Porto's Bakery</a></h2>
<p>They call themselves a cuban bakery, but this place is great for breakfast, lunch, and a coffee break. Sandwiches, soups, baked-goods, and deserts. Try the Cubano sandwich, the potato balls, and any of their deserts. I'm here maybe 3 times a week.</p>

<h2><a href="http://www.oliveandthyme.com">Olive & Thyme</a></h2>
<p>Not only a great breakfast and lunch place, but also serves the best coffee this side of the hill. A little on the pricy side, but worth it for the great food and the wonderful atmosphere. My wife says "it's like an Anthropology in here!"</p>

<h2><a href="http://jinya-ramenbar.com">Jinya Ramen Bar</a></h2>
<p>There are many ramen spots in LA, and the best are on the West Side, which means I don't get to eat at them very often. This gem serves some of my favorite ramen, is always packed, and is now a staple in my diet. With each bowl of ramen they'll ask if you want skinny or fat noodles, get the fat.</p>

<h2><a href="http://link.com">Stout</a></h2>
<p>A bar/burger joint, makes one of the best burgers I've ever had. But some people don't like it at all. One of those places you can't ask for customizations, they serve what's on the menu, that's it. Lunch service is great but I've had bad luck with dinner.</p>

Simple, decidedly not fancy, a hole-in-the-wall, with flat-out amazing food. The waiters have all worked there for a long time, ensure you ask them what they recommend, and take it seriously - don't just order enchiladas.</p>

<p>I was down in San Gabriel shooting a movie and a friend of mine (a food lover) took one look at the on-set catering and said "I've got a place." I've learned to trust him blindly when he says things like this - and I swear to God the pan-fried dumpings I ate from this place were one of the most magical things I've eaten. There's a line around the block sometimes and they close the doors when they sell out of food. Lunch only, I think.</p>
