<h1>Oliver's Favorite L.A. Restuarants</h1>
<p>Here in Los Angeles you can get some of the best food in the world, and no matter where you are in the city there are thousands of wonderful restaurants near you. This guide is a list of my favorite places (I’ve been to all of them), organized by neighborhood.</p>

<h3><a href="http://www.portosbakery.com">Porto's Bakery</a></h3>
<p>They call themselves a cuban bakery, but this place is great for breakfast, lunch, and a coffee break. Sandwiches, soups, baked-goods, and deserts. Try the Cubano sandwich, the potato balls, and any of their deserts. I'm here maybe 3 times a week.</p>

<h3><a href="http://www.oliveandthyme.com">Olive & Thyme</a></h3>
<p>Not only a great breakfast and lunch place, but also serves the best coffee this side of the hill. A little on the pricy side, but worth it for the great food and the wonderful atmosphere. My wife says "it's like an Anthropology in here!"</p>

<h3><a href="http://jinya-ramenbar.com">Jinya Ramen Bar</a></h3>
<p>There are many ramen spots in LA, and the best are on the West Side, which means I don't get to eat at them very often. This gem serves some of my favorite ramen, is always packed, and is now a staple in my diet. With each bowl of ramen they'll ask if you want skinny or fat noodles, get the fat.</p>

<p>Of all the fancy pizza in L.A. (and there is a lot) this place is unique for a few reasons; the dough is phenomenal, it's not a white-tablecloth kind of place, and they don't get ridiculous with what's on the pizza.</p>

<h3>Stout</h3>
<p>A bar/burger joint, makes one of the best burgers I've ever had. But some people don't like it at all. One of those places you can't ask for customizations, they serve what's on the menu, that's it. Lunch service is great but I've had bad luck with dinner.</p>

<p>A great place to go when you want to feel like you live in the city, not so great if you like a quiet meal. I'm not sure why but this is possibly the loudest restaurant I've ever been in. But it's worth it because the food is really great and it's a lot of fun.</p>

<h3>Food Lab</h3>
<p>Sandwich shop, spectacular ingredients, great atmosphere, and some very interesting food. Don't be turned-off by the (fairly) ostentatious presentation [it's the kind of place that would list the farms their ingredients came from and the waiters would scoff if you asked for sweet-and-low].</p>

<h3>La Cabanita <span>Montrose</span></h3>
<p>I grew up in New Mexico, so it's not that I have a high bar for Mexican food, it's that I can spot the fakers easily. This place is the real deal. Simple, decidedly not fancy, a hole-in-the-wall, with flat-out amazing food. The waiters have all worked there for a long time, ensure you ask them what they recommend, and take it seriously - don't just order enchiladas.</p>

<h3>Luscious Dumplings <span>San Gabriel</span></h3>
<p>I was down in San Gabriel shooting a movie and a friend of mine (a food lover) took one look at the on-set catering and said "I've got a place." I've learned to trust him blindly when he says things like this - and I swear to God the pan-fried dumpings I ate from this place were one of the most magical things I've eaten. There's a line around the block sometimes and they close the doors when they sell out of food. Lunch only, I think.</p>
