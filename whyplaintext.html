<h2>Two Reasons for Writing in Plain Text</h2>

<p>Almost every website, piece of software, or communication protocol ever programed was written (at least in part) in plain-text. This makes it the most compatible, reliable, and flexible file-format in existence; one who writes in plain-text can rest assured their files will be readable forever by any computer ever made in their lifetime.</p>

<p>Because programmers work almost exclusively in plain-text they have built themselves amazing tools. With a little work one can learn how to leverage these powerful tools and customize their writing environment as they see fit.</p>

<p>For those who want a universal and future-proof way to store their writing, and powerful and reliable software to write in, plain-text is the ticket.</p>
